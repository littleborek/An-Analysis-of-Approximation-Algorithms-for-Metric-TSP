Approximation Algorithms for Metric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) - Python

This repository contains implementations of three algorithms for solving the Metric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):

Greedy Algorithm
Christofides Algorithm
Slightly Improved Christofides Algorithm

The algorithms are compared in terms of total cost and execution time, with visual representations of the computed tours for each dataset.

Results
Metric Evaluation: The total cost of the computed tours for each algorithm is compared.
Spatial Comparison: The computed routes are visualized and compared on a 2D plane for each dataset.
